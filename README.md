# parametric-curves

For this question, you will use MATLAB to create parametric curves repre-
senting the first letters in your first and last name, separated by an ampersand enclosed in
the outline of a hand drawn heart. Each letter should be in upper or lower case. Create
parametric curves representing the outline of an image of a heart with your first and last
initial separated by an ampersand inside the heart, written in cursive (handwriting).
